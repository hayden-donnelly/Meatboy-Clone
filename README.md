## About

This is a meatboy 'clone' that I created for my ICS3U (computer science) culminating. Since the class required me to use Python, I ported a bit of C code from an early version of ![Feather Engine](https://github.com/Bizbud/Feather-Engine) and built the rest of the game on top of it.

To start the game, run src/main.py from the root of the repository - you'll need PyGame.
